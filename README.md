# My-Code-Katas
This repository contains a collection of code katas that I have completed over the years for practice and skill-building. Each kata focuses on a specific programming concept or technique and includes completed code. I am currently in the process of revising many of my older projects using the knowledge and skills I have acquired over time. This revision process allows me to apply my updated understanding to enhance the functionality, efficiency, and overall quality of my code.
